# InDesign Scripts

## JS_TABLE_COL_width_incl_row1.jsx
Removes whitespace in column after content including header row.

## JS_TABLE_COL_width_sans_row1.jsx
Removes whitespace in column after content excluding header row.

## JS_TABLE_width.jsx
Extends or compress column based on the width of the table type. This script will prompt you to select between several options, each corresponding to a table width. 

## JS_textframe_style_fix.jsx
This fixes the template shift issue. This script will prompt you for the spread side you'd like to affect, or you may affect both. If the overall positioning of the page textframe (catalog_textframe_L or catalog_textframe_R), then run the accompanying script JS_textframe_position_fix.jsx (see below).

## JS_textframe_position_fix.jsx
In regards to the template shift issue, if the overall positioning of the page textframe (catalog_textframe_L or catalog_textframe_R), then run this script, which moves either or both textframes into their proper places. Essentially, this script pushes each textframe closer to the spine.
